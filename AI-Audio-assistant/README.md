> Mix your music using natural language.  
> An AI assistant that works directly in your DAW like a real sound engineer.

## 🎥 Demo Video

Say things like *"Add EQ to the vocals"* or *"Add some reverb to the guitar"*, and the AI does it.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**SoundMixAI** is a smart interface that lets independent musicians, beatmakers, and home producers mix their tracks using **natural language commands**.

### You can say:
- *"Balance the volume between all tracks"*
- *"Apply a high-pass EQ to the vocals"*
- *"Add delay to the guitar, but keep it short"*
- *"Avoid frequency clashes between the kick and the bass"*

And the AI:
- Directly controls your DAW via API or scripting
- Applies mixing effects and processes as requested
- Leverages best-practice mixing knowledge (via a RAG system built from a curated PDF guide)
- Can be supervised and corrected in real-time to improve results

## 🧠 Why This Project?

As a music producer myself, I’ve always struggled with mixing.  
It’s not a lack of creativity — just a lack of technical know-how.

So I built **an AI to assist me**, like having a sound engineer right next to me in the studio.

This AI doesn’t replace my ears — but it gives me:
- A **solid foundation** for every mix
- **Technical help** with EQs, effects, and volume balance
- A much **faster workflow**

For someone who’s always battled with mixing, this has been a **game changer**.  
And I hope it can become the same for other independent creators.
